# Autonomous Driving Car Project

## Purpose
Predicting the steering wheel angle of a car given an image of the road ahead of the car. Predictions are made using a convolutional neural network trained on 33,749 road images. A webapp hosted on AWS to display the full functionality is currently in progress. Current implentation processes a set of 10,000 images

## Current Implementation
Testing runs on local machine. 10,000 test images are processed and then displayed using a tkinter GUI, which allows the user to navigate through the results. Pictures with their associated accuracies are displayed, and can be sorted by highest and lowest accuracy.

## Future Implementation
A webapp hosted on AWS that runs the Python test scripts on the back-end server and then displays the results on an interactive website. Project is in development and will be done in Spring 2022.

## Dataset
Dataset of road images taken from NVIDIA.

## Developed using
* Python
